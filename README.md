Heart Attack Predictor


1.	Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the heart attack in humans based on several factors including age, death, platelets, serum creatinine, and blood pressure. By analyzing these variables, we aim to create a model that can assist in identifying individuals who may be at higher risk of experiencing a heart attack.

2.	Objective

The objective of this project is to utilize probability and statistical analysis techniques to build a predictive model that can effectively estimate the probability of a heart attack based on various input features. 
By accomplishing this objective, we aim to provide a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals who require further medical attention and intervention to mitigate their risk of heart attacks.


3.	Data Description
The dataset used for this project contains information on several variables related to individuals who have experienced heart attacks. The variables included in the dataset are age, death, platelets, serum creatinine, and blood pressure. Each variable provides essential information about the individual's health status and potential risk factors associated with heart attacks.

Age: The age of the individual.
Death: A variable indicating whether the individual has experienced a heart attack 
Platelets: The level of platelets in the individual's blood.
Serum Creatinine: The level of creatinine in the individual's serum.
Blood Pressure: The individual's blood pressure reading.
